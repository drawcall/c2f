C2F is an interesting little project. I hope to find a way to convert css styles to flutter styles. I believe many web developers will like it. [https://drawcall.github.io/c2f/](https://drawcall.github.io/c2f/)

## Statement

For beginners, the flutter style is really hard to remember. I want to build a website that converts css styles to flutter style online. Maybe it will help those web developers get started quickly.

### NOTE

Although I have already written a part of the code, there are still a lot of styles that I have not converted. I very much hope that you can join and participate, sincerely invite

I want to use `postcss` to do a lot of things, we can get a style attribute and value, and then do a big mapping table... If you have a better idea, you can implement it together.

## Run and build

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

```shell

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
